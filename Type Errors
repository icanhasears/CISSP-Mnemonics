False rejection = FRR - Type 1 error (correct person was rejected )
    - Right person, rejected (RR)
    - Dry skin can cause fingerprint not to be read

False acceptance rate = FAR - Type 2 error (wrong person was accepted)

Crossover error rate = FAR and FRR cross  (equal)
    - this is the goal

    FRR = Type 1
    FAR = type 2
