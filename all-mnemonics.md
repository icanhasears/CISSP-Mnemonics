Risk Analysis Steps
For Quantitative Risk Analysis
1. Inventory Assets and assign an asset value (AV)
2. Identify Threats - Research each asset and produce a list of all possible threats of each asset (and calculate EF and SLE)
3. Perform a threat analysis to calculate the liklihood of each threat being realised in a year (ARO)
4. Estimate the potential loss by calculating the anualized loss expectancy (ALE)
5. Reasearch countermeasures for each threat and then calculate the changes to ARO and ALE based on the applied countermeasures
6. Perform a cost / benifit analysis of each of our counteremasures to determine cost vs reward

Qualitative - less acurate, based on scoring system = subjective...

    Delphi Technique
    - Anonymous feedback and response process used to arrive at a consensus

Loss potential = what would be lost if the threat agent is successful in exploiting a vulnerability
Delayed loss = the amount of loss that can occure *over time*

Risk Management
SLE = AV * EF% (as decimal)

Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - Negative impact for one-time occurrence
Asset Value (AV)
Exposure Factor (EF) - If a flood will damage 40% of your data center, EF is 40%
ARO

Annual Rate of Occurance
ALE = ARO * SLE

End to end example:
Office building - $ 200 000
Hurricane damage esimate 50%
Hurricane provability is 1 in 10 years (10%)
SLE = AV * EF 200 000 * .50 = $100 0000
ALE - SLE *ARO 100 000 * 0.10 = $10 000

Safeguards must not cost more than ALE - Safeguard evaluation : 
    - ALE before safeguadrd - ALE after safeguard - Cost of safeguar = value of safeguard
    ALE1 - ALE2 - ACS = value of safeguard

Conrols gap is the difference between total risk and residual risk:
total risk - controls gap = residual risk

Total Risk
Threat * vulnerabilities * asset value = total risk

Risk 
Risk = Threat * Vulnerability

üç∫ = üòç (get it?)
Ale makes arousal
Annual Loss Expectancy = Rate of Occurrence - Single Loss Expectancy


Threat Modeling
Either focused on:
- Assets - uses asset valuation results to identify threats to the valuable assets
- Attackers - Identify potential attackers and identify threats based on the attackers goals
- Software - Considers potential threats against the software the org develops

STRIDE - Microsoft threat modeling tool

S poofing
T ampering
R epudiation - attacker can deny participation
I nformation disclosure
D enial of service
E levation of privilege
Control Types
PTA keeps the children safe!

PASTA - focuses on developing countermeasures based on asset value:
Stage 1 : Definition of Objectives
Stage 2 : Definition of technical scope
Stage 3 App decomposition and Analysis 
Stage 4 : Threat analysis
Stage 5 WEakness and Vulnerability analysis
Stage 6 Attack modeling and Simulation
Stage 7 Risk analysis and management


VAST - GOAL is scalable integration of threat managfement into an Agile programming environment

DREAD - based on answer to 5 questions
- Damage potential
- Reproducibility 
- Exploitability
- Affected users
- Discoverability

TRIKE - focused on acceptable risk
                   
P hysical - Tangible. Locks, guards, alligator moats, etc.
T echincal/Logical - Automated or electronic systems.
A dministrative - Policy, signage.
Due Care vs Due Diligence
Imagine you have a pool. To protect children and animals from drowning in your pool, you exercise due care by building a fence around the pool. Regularly checking the fence for vulnerabilities and correcting them demonstrates due diligence.

BCP - Business continuity planning ( issues thatpertain to information security in)
*How to continue business
*focus on whole business
Overall polict
1. Strategy development
2. Provisions and processes
3. Plan approval
4. Plan implementation
5. Training and education

DRP -returning the IT infrastructure to operation
*focus on technical aspects
Part of BCP policy

Due Care - A vendor engaging in a reasonable and expected manner for the circumstance
Due Diligence - Demonstrates due care

Security Models
Brewer-Nash
Brewer-Nash is also known as "The Chinese Wall" and protects against conflict of interest. Remember Chinese "brew" tea. üçµ

Simple Security vs *-Security
You must read before you can write. So reading is "simpler" than writing. This makes reading the simple security model and writing the *-security model.

Integrity vs Confidentiality models
Integrity Models have the letter "I" in them.
Bell LaPadula and Biba - Since Biba has an "I" I it, it is integrity. The two are opposite so Bell is confidentiality. For some something confidential you don't want a subject reading up above their security. So Bell has a no read up property. With this we can extract read and write for both Biba and Bell
Bell	Biba
No Read Up	Read Up
Write Down	No Write Down
Domain 4: Communications & Network Security
Factorization of Primes vs Discreet Logs
Found this somewhere else but it made me laugh and was easy to remember: Mr. Diffie-Hellman and Dr. ElGamal are phantom poopers! They leave discreet logs!

DES Modes of Operation
Most important thing here is remember strength from weakest to strongest. No clear mnemonic to do this. My approach:

Remember the first and the last.
The center 3 are alphabetical by name and/or abbreviation.
ECB - Electronic Code Block (also the only one that doesn't support an initialization vector)
CBC - Cipher Block Chaining
CFB - Cipher Feedback
OFB - Output Feedback Mode
CTR - Counter
